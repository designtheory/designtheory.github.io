<p>What is lorem ipsum?

They are nothing but random,jumbled,unpronounceable words arranged in paragraphs to fake an actual article.The main purpose of
using lorem ipsum is to focus more on the graphic element rather than the text. It also saves a lot of time for designers 
as they need not write up text for their designs and can easily generate lorem ipsum from various generators available online.

But how do computers generate these words?

Well there are various easy methods for a programmer to create an algorithm that can generate random words, but 
they didnt look natural enough for the eye to look like an article. The Solution was easy, take an article from a book,
jumble them and there you go, you get natural looking senseless paragraph that can be used and yes! thats what they did.
The book they used was written in 45BC by a roman philosopher named Marcus Tullius Cicero. He wrote a book called 
De finibus bonorum et malorum ("On the ends of good and evil"). Lorem ipsum is derived from parts of his books discourse
on hedonism. <p>
